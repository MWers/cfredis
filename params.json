{"name":"cfredis","body":"# cfredis #\r\n\r\ncfredis is a ColdFusion wrapper for the [Jedis](https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis/) Java client for [Redis](http://redis.io/).\r\n\r\nTo use cfredis, first download Jedis and place it somewhere within your ColdFusion classpath (or better yet, use JavaLoader to include it):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/xetorthio/jedis/downloads\r\n\r\nThen place the following initialization code in the `OnRequestStart` method in `Application.cfc`, in `OnRequestStart.cfm`, or in `Application.cfm`:\r\n\r\n```cfm\r\n<cfset request.redis = CreateObject(\"component\",\"cfredis\").init() />\r\n<cfset pool = CreateObject(\"java\",\"redis.clients.jedis.JedisPool\") />\r\n<cfset pool.init(\"redis.server.hostname.or.ip.address\", redis.port) />\r\n<cfset request.redis.connectionPool = pool />\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn a page where you wish to make a Redis connection, do so as follows:\r\n\r\n```cfm\r\n<cfset request.redis.set(\"your:key:name\", \"key value\") />\r\n<cfset value = request.redis.get(\"your:key:name\") />\r\n```\r\n\r\ncfredis implements all of the Redis methods implemented in redis.clients.jedis.Jedis with the following changes:\r\n\r\n* `ltrim` has been renamed to `_ltrim` to avoid conflicts with the built-in CF function `LTrim()`\r\n\r\n* The following overloaded Jedis methods have been combined to singular CF methods:\r\n    * `sort`\r\n    * `zinterstore`\r\n    * `zrangeByScore`\r\n    * `zrangeByScoreWithScores`\r\n    * `zrevrangeByScore`\r\n    * `zrevrangeByScoreWithScores`\r\n    * `zunionstore`\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems with cfredis, please submit an issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/MWers/cfredis/issues\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to help to make cfredis better, please fork this project and submit a pull request. A great place to start would be in creating MXUnit tests. They can be based on the Jedis JUnit tests here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/xetorthio/jedis/tree/master/src/test/java/redis/clients/jedis/tests\r\n\r\nThanks!","tagline":"A Redis client for ColdFusion","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
